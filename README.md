# YATTA - Yet AnoTher Todo App

YATTA is a web app for managing your todo list. Yes... another one.
What's special about this todo app?
Well first, _I_ made it. Also, it is my first project in Go.
Secondly, no React, Angular or Vue! In fact, you probably won't see much JavaScript here, just a little bit of [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and a whole load of server-side rendering.

## Running tests

```shell
go test ./...
```

## Name

YATTA comes from the Japanese phrase やった！(yatta), which means "hooray" or literally "I/We/You did it!".
You know, the kind of thing you say when you check off an item on your todo list.
